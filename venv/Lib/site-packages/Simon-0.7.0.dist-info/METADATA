        Note About Releases
        ===================
        
        Simon is not yet considered production-ready. While I will do my best to
        maintain backward compatibility between now and version 1.0, I cannot
        guarantee it will happen.
        
        The original development releases may eventually be pulled from Read the
        Docs and PyPI. You are encouraged to keep your version up-to-date until
        the release of 1.0 to avoid running into problems.
        
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        Define a model::
        
            from simon import Model
        
            class User(Model):
                """A model to represent users"""
        
        Connect to a database::
        
            from simon.connection import connect
        
            connect('localhost', name='simon')
        
        And start using it::
        
            User.create(name='Simon')
        
            user = User.get(name='Simon')
            user.email = 'simon@example.com'
            user.save()
        
        Full documentation can be found on `Read the Docs`_.
